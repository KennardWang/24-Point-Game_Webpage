## Usage

You can play [online](https://kennardwang.github.io/24-Points-Webpage-Game/html/) or play in a local environment. If playing locally, please start from **StartPage.html** rather than **Game.html**, otherwise, you will get a static webpage. The description of files are following:

+ index.html
  > It is a login page. The Player Name/Password is **Kennard/WangYuyang**.

+ StartPage.html
  > There are two modes
  > + Under **Normal** mode, the range of cards is **1~9**. (A = 1)
  > + Under **Hard** mode, the range of cards is **1~13**. (A = 1, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13) 
  > <br>
  >
  > There are also two versions
  > + Select the new version (default) without ticking the checkbox. This version has a more friendly GUI, and users can play by mouse-clicking.
  > + Select the old version by ticking the checkbox. In this version, users need to play with keyboard typing.

+ Game.html (new version)
  > 1. Users need to choose 2 cards in order, and then click operator button to calculate. For example, calculating "9/3", please choose "9" first and then "3". After clicking "/" button, the result will be recorded in **result1** (a black box on the right).
  > 2. The **result1** can also be selected for calculation like a card, and you can get **result2** in the same way as **result1**. 
  > 3. By the way, the selected card can be cancelled by clicking them once again as long as not clicking operator button. 
  > 4. Users can click **Reset** button to clear all choices and calculated results as well as reset all the cards. 
  > 5. If having no idea about current puzzle, use **Skip** to jump to the next puzzle. After all, we cannot guarantee that all the puzzles have answers.
  > 6. Users will get 24 points if their answer is correct.

+ GameOld.html (old version)
  > 1. The input must follow this format: For each step, users must add parenthesis to tell clearly which operation executes first. Although "\*" and "/" has higher priority than "+" and "-", but still need to add parenthesis. For example, if wanting to compute "11+13", users need to input "(11+13)" instead. Likewise, please use "((3\*8)+2)" to represent "3*8+2". Furthermore, the answer to "3, 11, 1, 11" should be "((11+11)+(3-1))". A good way to check the answer is checking pairs of parenthesis. 
  > 2. Additionally, space is not allowed in the answer. 
  > 3. Users will get 24 points if their answer is correct.

+ Grade.html
  > This page demonstrates excellent grades got by intelligent players. Click **sort** to show results in 3 different orders: **Name Alphabetical**, **Age Ascending** and **Point Descending**.
